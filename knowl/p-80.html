<div class="para">A sample should possess identical characteristics to the population it is representing. In order for a sample to accurately reflect a population, it must include the main traits of that population. good sample copies the distribution of qualities, behaviors, attitudes, and demographics present in the larger group it seeks to study. Factors like sample size, selection method, and statistical significance have an effect in determining how well a sample represents the population’s essence. However, at its core, the more similarity between a sample and the population in key parameters, the better it can act as a small-scale model, providing useful insights about the whole. A thoughtful sampling approach that considers the population’s diversity and complexity is a critical driver for generalizing conclusions.</div>
