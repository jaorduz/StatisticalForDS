<div class="para">Letâ€™s say you want to conduct a survey about transportation preferences in a city with many neighborhoods. You decide to use multistage sampling to gather your data.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Stage 1 - First-Level Sampling: You divide the city into districts. You randomly select three districts out of the total ten districts.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Stage 2 - Second-Level Sampling: In each of the selected districts, you further divide them into blocks. You then randomly select two blocks from each of the three chosen districts.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Stage 3 - Third-Level Sampling: Finally, within each selected block, you create a list of streets. From each block, you randomly select one street.</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">On these selected streets, you conduct your survey by asking residents about their transportation preferences. This process of breaking down the sampling into stages helps you efficiently collect data from a large city while maintaining a representative sample.</div>
