  "body": " Sampling     Introduce concepts and correct terminology to organize data.     This section shows sampling concepts and more.  Data must be organized and descripted, this is relevant in any analysis.  How are we going to call a database? To use a common name could leave lack of clarity. Therefore, people use some characteristics of the database.  The first word in the first column  The number of rows\/columns  This is an informal way to talk about columns, rows, database and more. Then, we proceed to formalize some relevant concepts.  Variables Variables are the formal name to identify columns in a database. This variables represent the Characteristics Characteristics for each row.  Case Case is the word to call each row. AKA observational unit.  Data Matrix Matrix data- is the way to organize data. This is convenient to put in a spreadsheet.      Let us check a Data Matrix Data Matrix    This is a representation of a data base as a Data Matrix Data Matrix . We have the columns and rows. Check this information and respond the next exercises.          How many characteristics there are in the table of ?  How many cases there are in the table of ?  What might the name be for the table of ?     carsn, modelyearn, or CarConsumptionN    Organize the following data in a Data Matrix Data Matrix .  Charles, GPA 3.4; Michael, GPA 3.5; Juan, GPA 3.5; Emma, GPA 3.6, Anne, GPA 3.8; Melody GPA 3.7   As we see in , data can be represented in different ways, Variables Variables and Cases Cases can be of different types.   Types of variables    Variable Variable can share characteristics, but each variables is different in terms of meaning, shape and representation.    Differences are important, and it means it is not possible to operate with mathematical symbols, or add extra information is not possible such area code, or ZIP-Code. In addition, some amounts require discrete numbers, and talk about decimal (continuous) numbers in, for example, population is not possible. On the other hand, some variables can bre represented by acronymous such as state, e.g. IN, NY, CA, etc.   Types of variables.   Types of variables.      Types of variables:    Numerical Numerical It refers variables that can take a wide range of numerical values.     Types of variables:    Discrete Discrete This kind of variable takes non-negative numerical values.     Types of variables:    Continuous Continous This kind of numerical variables is not discrete, this concept might be debatible concept, but it can considered as a infinitesimal numerical value.     Types of variables:    Categorical Categorical This kind of variables are category per se. It means the responses migth have a range of choices.     Types of variables:    Variable's Levels Levels variable's- are the possible range of values for categorical variable.     Types of variables:    Ordinal Ordinal it is a categorical variable whose variable's levels have a natural ordering.     Types of variables:    Nominal Nominal it is a categorical variable whose variable's levels have an unordering.     Provide three short databases with examples of different kinds of variables.       True    False   The number of siblings might represent numerical variables.        True: By definition it is a number.           True    False   People height might represent continuous categorical variables.        False: By definition, categorical variables are not continuous.       Let us talk about a relationship between variables. Most researcher look for relationship between variables. And similarly, we start our questions and variables are in (scientific) questions.  How far is Sun from Earth?  What is the probability to obtain a kind of particle in a decay process?  What is power consumption bill for a family with four members?  In general, resesearchers want to figure out relationships between variables, and to do it, numerical, and graphical analysis are relevant.  When a researcher finds a relationship then variables are associated Variables Variables associated- are also known as dependant Variables.   Database can be analyzed from different ways and it will open the fact to have more questions. To do this, we have other definitions:  Negative association Association negative- out the trend in a scatterplot.  Positive association Association positive- in the trend in a scatterplot  Independent variables Variables independent no evident relationship between two variables.  Explanatory variables Variables explanatory- these kind of variables (probably) affect another. AKA independent variable.  Response variables Variables response- these kind of variable (probably) will be affected by the response variables. AKA dependent variable.  Observational study Study observational- It means a study to collect data without interfiring how the data arise.  Experiments Experiment(s) Situations where researchers explore a potential causal connection.  Randomized experiment Experiment(s) randomized- It is the random assignation of individuals in groups to test the explanatory or response variables.  Association Association It means a correlation between variables, but it does not imply causation.  Causation Causation It is inferred from random experiments.       Observational studies might be  Surveys  Records  Other situations where people can collect and not interfere with data.       Experimental studies might be  Administer a medicine during a period to reduce any risk.  Measure distances and times to obtain speed.  Other situations where researchers make an arrangement to have data and find correlations.     Sampling and other concepts.  How are data collected? It is important to achieve objectives.   What do population population and sample sample mean? To stablish a question, we inherently think in a population. This population has several features, and requirements. We will call the population or target population. Every member in the population stands for a case. Since collecting each case usually is too expensive, so we consider a sample.   The following is relevant in our course.      Sample Sample it is a subset of cases and represents a small fraction of population.      Identify the target population  Does a new medicine reduce the number of deaths in patients with severe heart disease?          Anecdotal Evidence Evidence anecdotal- are data collected in a random and hazard (haphazard) fashion. These usually represent extraordinary cases.      An answer to the question ``What is the average mercury content in swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean?\"  A man on the news got mercury poisoning from eating swordfish, so the average mercury concentration in swordfish must be dangerously high.       Assuming each the conclusion was obtained from data, there are two issues  The data represent fewer cases.  It is unclear if the cases representive of the population.     Sampling and population  Sampling, population and bias      Bias bias the fact which permits data manipulation with or without intention of favoring any output.  Simple random sample Sample -random- simple-- Is the most basic random sample that introduces ramdomness, namely, Sampling randomly Randomly sampling to avoid any particular benefit.  The act of taking Simple random sample helps to minimize the bias.    There are other relevant concepts       Non-response rate Rate non-response- is the rate of responses and we would pursue it to be high.   Non-response bias Bias Non-response- means a non-reponse rate low since it cannot be representative of the population.   Convenience sample Sample convenience- is the fact of including the cases that are easily accessible then they are more likely to be included in the sample. is the fact of including the cases that are more likely to be included in the sample and they are easily accessible.       Observational Studies  We start with some definitions       Observational data Data observational- this is how we call data wich don't have any applied treatment. Observational studies Studies sbservational- are sufficcient to show associations or stablish hypothesis to be verified trought different experiments.  Observational studies have two forms: Prospective Studies prospective- and Retrospective Studies retrospective- . The first one identifies individuals and collects information as event unfold. The retrospective study collects data after events happened.   Confounding variable Variable confounding is a variable which correlated with both explanatory and response variables. AKA lurking, confounder factor, or confounder.      We intruduce the following sampling techniques in order to assure the randomness and the statistical validity.   Sampling methods.   Sampling methods.          Simple sampling It was defined on such as the most basic random sample that introduces ramdomness. It is the most intuitive form of random sampling. AKA Simple random.   Stratified sampling Sampling stratified- The population is divided in groups called Strata Strata (sing. Stratum) . It is useful when each Stratum are very similar with respect to outcome of interest.   Cluster sampling Sampling Cluster- The populaion is divided in groups called Clusters Clusters . Then we sample a fixed number of clusters and include all observations from each of those clusters in the sample.   Multistage sampling Sampling multistage- is similar to cluster sample, but we collect a random sample within each selected cluster.
