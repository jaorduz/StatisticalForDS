<p>This section shows sampling concepts and more.
</p>    
    <p>
      Data must be organized and descripted, this is relevant in any analysis.
    </p>

<p>
How are we going to call a database? To use a common name could leave lack of clarity.
Therefore, people use some characteristics of the database.
  <ul>
    <li>The first word in the first column</li>  
    <li>The number of rows/columns</li>  
  </ul>
This is an informal way to talk about columns, rows, database and more. Then, we proceed to formalize 
some relevant concepts.
  <ul>
    <li><term>Variables</term><idx><h>Variables</h></idx> are the formal name to identify columns in a database. 
    This variables represent the <term>Characteristics</term><idx><h>Characteristics</h></idx> for each row.</li>
    <li><term>Case</term><idx><h>Case</h></idx> is the word to call each row. AKA observational unit.</li>
   <li><term>Data Matrix</term><idx><h>Matrix</h><h>data-</h></idx> is the way to organize data. This is convenient to put in a spreadsheet.</li>
  </ul>

<p>
Differences are important, and it means it is not possible to operate with 
mathematical symbols, or add extra information is not possible such area code, or ZIP-Code.
In addition, some amounts require discrete numbers, and talk about decimal (continuous) numbers in, 
for example, population is not possible.  
On the other hand, some variables can bre represented by acronymous such as state, e.g. IN, NY, CA, etc.

    Let us talk about a relationship between variables.
Most researcher look for relationship between variables. 
And similarly, we start our questions and variables are in (scientific) questions.
<ul>
    <li>How far is Sun from Earth?</li>
    <li>What is the probability to obtain a kind of particle in a decay process?</li>
    <li>What is power consumption bill for a family with four members?</li>    
    </ul>
In general, resesearchers want to figure out relationships between variables, and to do it, 
numerical, and graphical analysis are relevant.
</p>

<p>
    When a researcher finds a relationship then variables are 
    <term>associated Variables</term><idx><h>Variables</h><h>associated-</h></idx>
    are also known as dependant Variables.

  <p>Sampling and other concepts. </p>

  <p>
    How are data collected? It is important to achieve objectives.

<remark>
  <p>What do <term>population</term><idx><h>population</h></idx> and 
    <term>sample</term><idx><h>sample</h></idx> mean?
      To stablish a question, we inherently think in a population. This population has several
      features, and requirements. We will call the population or target population. 
      Every member in the population stands for a case. 
      Since collecting each case usually is too expensive, so we consider 
      a sample.

<p>A sample should possess identical characteristics to the population it is representing. 
  In order for a sample to accurately reflect a population, 
  it must include the main traits of that population. 
   good sample copies the distribution of qualities, behaviors, 
   attitudes, and demographics present in the larger group it seeks to study. 
   Factors like sample size, selection method, and statistical significance 
   have an effect in determining how well a sample represents the population's 
   essence. However, at its core, the more similarity between a sample and the 
   population in key parameters, the better it can act as a small-scale model, 
   providing useful insights about the whole. A thoughtful sampling approach 
   that considers the population's diversity and complexity is a critical driver 
   for generalizing conclusions.</p>

Ahmed hopes to assemble a 5-person research team (himself and four others) 
from his microeconomics course, which has 28 students excluding Ahmed. 
To select a simple random sample of size four from the other class members, 
Ahmed could enter all 28 names into a spreadsheet. We propose different options
<ol>
  <li>Options 1) Randomize the order, close his eyes, and take the first four names.</li>
  <li>Option 2) Ahmed to first record the last names 
    of the classmates along with a twi-digit number, generate random numbers, and create pairs 
    associated to each ID, first group consists of the first four-pairs found by the random 
    numbers, second group similarly, and so on. Such as 0.901245, it has 90, 01, 12, 24, 45. Where 
    01, 12, and 24 will correspond to three numbers in the list. To get more numbers, we could generate more random 
    numbers.

  </li>
    <li>Option 3) Each student should enumerate from 0-1 or 1-4. It works with other 
      elements such as animals, and letters with a sequence.

    <term>Stratified sample.</term><idx><h>sample</h><h>stratified-</h></idx> 
    This method splits the population in different strata - groups - 
    and then takes a proportional number of samples from each group.

      Juan could segment his university population by school/department -strata- first, 
      and then select an appropriate simple random sample from each division 
      to obtain a stratified random sample.     
      He obtains a <term>Simple random sample.</term><idx><h>sample</h><h>-random-</h><h>simple-</h></idx> 
      from each department by:
<ol>
  <li>Numbering each member of the first department, 
    numbering each member of the second department. 
    Continuing numbering for the remaining departments.</li>
  <li>Applying <term>Simple random sample.</term> to select 
    appropriate numbers from the first department. 
    Repeating this for each of the other departments.</li>
</ol>    
  The numbers selected from the first department, 
  second department, etc. constitute the members comprising the stratified sample.

    Suppose a research team wants to survey undergraduate students at a College about their housing preferences. The total university population is 1,000 students. 
    They could take a stratified sample by:</p>
    <p>
<ul> <li>Dividing the population into strata (subgroups) by class year: 
  freshman, sophomores, juniors, seniors.</li>

<li>Calculating the percentage of students in each year:
Freshman <m>30\%</m>, Sophomores <m>25\%</m>, Juniors <m>20\%</m> and 
Seniors <m>25\%.</m></li>

<li>Randomly surveying certain number from each subgroup: 
  30 Freshman (<m>30\%</m> of sample), 
  25 Sophomores (<m>25\%</m> of sample),
  20 Juniors (<m>20\%</m> of sample), and 
  25 Seniors (<m>25\%</m> of sample)</li>
</ul>
This ensures that each class year is represented in the sample according 
to its proportion of the total population. The total stratified 
sample size is 100 students.

The key point is that the sample is taken separately from different 
subpopulations or strata, rather than sampling randomly from one large group. 
This helps ensure proper representation.

      <term>Cluster sample.</term><idx><h>sample</h><h>Cluster-</h></idx> 
    This method split the population into clusters - groups- and then randomly 
  select some of the clusters.</p>
<p>Suppose a city wants to survey residents about their public transit needs. 
  The total city population is 50,000 people. A cluster sample should follow:
  <ul>
    <li>Split the city into clusters or groups based on location 
      - for example, by borough or neighborhood.</li>
    <li>Randomly pick some of the clusters - let's say 5 clusters are chosen.</li>
    <li>Survey all households within each selected cluster. If there are about 
      200 households per cluster on average, the survey would go to 1000 
      households total.</li>
    <li>The 1,000 surveyed households represent a 
      cluster sample of the full city population.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>The key points are 
  <ol>
  <li>The population is divided into clusters or groups first</li>
  <li>A random sample of clusters is taken rather than individuals</li>
  <li>Data is collected from every unit (household) within each sampled cluster</li>
  </ol>
Advantages: low cost, compare random individual sample.

      <term>Multistage sample.</term><idx><h>sample</h><h>Cluster-</h></idx> 
The key idea is that sampling is conducted in various stages, phases, or levels.  At each stage, the sample becomes more focused or localized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's say you want to conduct a survey about transportation preferences in a 
      city with many neighborhoods. You decide to use multistage sampling to gather 
      your data.
  <ul>
  <li>Stage 1 - First-Level Sampling: You divide the city into districts. You randomly select three districts out of the total ten districts.</li>
  <li>Stage 2 - Second-Level Sampling: In each of the selected districts, you further divide them into blocks. You then randomly select two blocks from each of the three chosen districts.</li>
  <li>Stage 3 - Third-Level Sampling: Finally, within each selected block, you create a list of streets. From each block, you randomly select one street.</li>
</ul>
On these selected streets, you conduct your survey by asking residents about their 
transportation preferences. This process of breaking down the sampling into stages 
helps you efficiently collect data from a large city while maintaining a representative sample.
</p>
    <p>
  Key characteristics:
  <ul>
  <li>The population is divided into primary sampling units at the first stage, based on geographical clusters.</li>
  <li>A sample of primary units is taken, and each selected unit is divided into secondary units in the next stage.</li>
  <li>This process continues for several stages, taking smaller samples at each level.</li>
  <li>By the final stage, individual subjects are sampled from within the small localized clusters.</li>
  <li>Can combine clustering and stratification strategies across stages.</li>
  </ul>
  -Multistage, multiphase, and multilevel- all communicate the defining feature 
  of this method, sampling through multiple steps progressively. 
  The terms refer to the same technique and can be used interchangeably.

<p>
  You're conducting a study on shopping habits in a mall with different sections. 
  You decide to use systematic cluster sampling to gather your data.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>Cluster Selection: You divide the mall into different sections - clothing, 
    electronics, groceries, etc. You randomly choose two (2) sections out of the total 
    five (5) sections.</li>
  <li>Systematic Sampling within Clusters: In each of the selected sections, 
    you use a systematic approach to select your sample. For instance, 
    you decide to survey every <m>5^{\text{th}}</m> shopper who enters the chosen sections.</li>
</ul>
By following this method, you can efficiently collect data from various 
sections of the mall while ensuring representation from different parts of the mall. 
This systematic cluster sampling approach streamlines the process while still 
capturing a diverse range of shoppers.

      <term>Covenience Sample</term><idx><h>Sample</h><h>convenience-</h></idx> 
      A convenience sample is a type of sampling where individuals or items 
      are selected based on their easy availability or accessibility, 
      rather than a systematic or random method. It's a sample that is 
      convenient to gather, but it might not accurately represent the entire 
      population.
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>


<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      <term>Covenience Sample</term> is a non-random sample method.
    </p>

    <p>
    A convenience sample involves choosing participants or items 
    that are readily accessible, often due to their proximity or 
    ease of inclusion, rather than utilizing a structured or random 
    selection process. 
    </p>
    <p>
This method is straightforward but might not 
    offer a fully representative snapshot of the entire group under study.
