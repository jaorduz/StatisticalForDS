  "body": " Data Basics     Discuss basic concepts about data and information.     We use and deal with data in our everyday lives. This data come from information, and to analyze them, we usually set up them. During this process, we can organize and summarize data.                              To summarize, and organize data, there are two ways: Graphs\/Plots, and Numbers.  Random numbers require Statistics Data Analysis. This field allows to consider all of the data at once. Which is convenient to analyze.   Researchers prepare an experiment which has 451 patients. This population is split in two groups, 224 group 1, and 227 in the group 2. Consider the following two tables where researchers took information after two periods, short and long.  Short period and long period.   This table shows data about this experiment.   Answer the following questions  What is the proportion of patients that had a Event 1 in the group 1?  What is the proportion of patients that had a Event 1 in the group 2?  What is the proportion of patients that had a No event in the group 1?  What is the proportion of patients that had a No event in the group 2?  What is the proportion of patients that had Event 1 in short period?  What is the proportion of patients that had No event in short period?  What is the proportion of patients that had Event 1 in long period?  What is the proportion of patients that had No event in long period?    Elementary statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. It is a fundamental tool for understanding our world and is used in a wide variety of fields, such as business, science, and government. Here are some of the key concepts in elementary statistics:  Data collection: This involves gathering information about a particular topic or population. Data can be collected through surveys, experiments, and observation.  Data organization: Once data has been collected, it needs to be organized in a way that makes it easy to understand and analyze. This can involve creating tables, charts, and graphs.  Data analysis: This involves using statistical methods to summarize and interpret data. This can involve calculating measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of variability (variance, standard deviation), and correlations.  Data interpretation: This involves making sense of the results of data analysis and drawing conclusions about the population or topic under study.  Data presentation: This involves communicating the results of data analysis to others in a clear and concise way. This can involve writing reports, creating presentations, and giving speeches.  Modeling is a process of representing a real-world system or phenomenon mathematically. Models can be used to make predictions about the future, to understand the behavior of a system, and to test hypotheses. Here are some of the types of models:  Statistical models: These models use statistical methods to represent the relationships between variables.  Machine learning models: These models use algorithms to learn from data and make predictions.  Physical models: These models are physical representations of a system or phenomenon.  Data science is a field that combines statistics, machine learning, and other disciplines to extract knowledge and insights from data. Data scientists use a variety of tools and techniques to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data. They then use this information to make predictions, solve problems, and improve decision-making. Data science is a rapidly growing field with applications in a wide variety of industries, such as healthcare, finance, retail, and government. Data scientists are in high demand, and their skills are highly valued. Finally, elementary statistics, modeling, and data science are all important tools for understanding our world. By understanding these concepts, we can make better decisions, solve problems, and improve our lives.    Extra material: Video        Extra material: Slides       "

  "body": " Sampling     Introduce concepts and correct terminology to organize data.     This section shows sampling concepts and more.  Data must be organized and descripted, this is relevant in any analysis.  How are we going to call a database? To use a common name could leave lack of clarity. Therefore, people use some characteristics of the database.  The first word in the first column  The number of rows\/columns  This is an informal way to talk about columns, rows, database and more. Then, we proceed to formalize some relevant concepts.  Variables Variables are the formal name to identify columns in a database. This variables represent the Characteristics Characteristics for each row.  Case Case is the word to call each row. AKA observational unit.  Data Matrix Matrix data- is the way to organize data. This is convenient to put in a spreadsheet.      Let us check a Data Matrix Data Matrix    This is a representation of a data base as a Data Matrix Data Matrix . We have the columns and rows. Check this information and respond the next exercises.          How many characteristics there are in the table of ?  How many cases there are in the table of ?  What might the name be for the table of ?     carsn, modelyearn, or CarConsumptionN    Organize the following data in a Data Matrix Data Matrix .  Charles, GPA 3.4; Michael, GPA 3.5; Juan, GPA 3.5; Emma, GPA 3.6, Anne, GPA 3.8; Melody GPA 3.7   As we see in , data can be represented in different ways, Variables Variables and Cases Cases can be of different types.   Types of variables    Variable Variable can share characteristics, but each variables is different in terms of meaning, shape and representation.    Differences are important, and it means it is not possible to operate with mathematical symbols, or add extra information is not possible such area code, or ZIP-Code. In addition, some amounts require discrete numbers, and talk about decimal (continuous) numbers in, for example, population is not possible. On the other hand, some variables can bre represented by acronymous such as state, e.g. IN, NY, CA, etc.   Types of variables.   Types of variables.      Types of variables:    Numerical Numerical It refers variables that can take a wide range of numerical values.     Types of variables:    Discrete Discrete This kind of variable takes non-negative numerical values.     Types of variables:    Continuous Continous This kind of numerical variables is not discrete, this concept might be debatible concept, but it can considered as a infinitesimal numerical value.     Types of variables:    Categorical Categorical This kind of variables are category per se. It means the responses migth have a range of choices.     Types of variables:    Variable's Levels Levels variable's- are the possible range of values for categorical variable.     Types of variables:    Ordinal Ordinal it is a categorical variable whose variable's levels have a natural ordering.     Types of variables:    Nominal Nominal it is a categorical variable whose variable's levels have an unordering.     Provide three short databases with examples of different kinds of variables.       True    False   The number of siblings might represent numerical variables.        True: By definition it is a number.           True    False   People height might represent continuous categorical variables.        False: By definition, categorical variables are not continuous.       Let us talk about a relationship between variables. Most researcher look for relationship between variables. And similarly, we start our questions and variables are in (scientific) questions.  How far is Sun from Earth?  What is the probability to obtain a kind of particle in a decay process?  What is power consumption bill for a family with four members?  In general, resesearchers want to figure out relationships between variables, and to do it, numerical, and graphical analysis are relevant.  When a researcher finds a relationship then variables are associated Variables Variables associated- are also known as dependant Variables.   Database can be analyzed from different ways and it will open the fact to have more questions. To do this, we have other definitions:  Negative association Association negative- out the trend in a scatterplot.  Positive association Association positive- in the trend in a scatterplot  Independent variables Variables independent no evident relationship between two variables.  Explanatory variables Variables explanatory- these kind of variables (probably) affect another. AKA independent variable.  Response variables Variables response- these kind of variable (probably) will be affected by the response variables. AKA dependent variable.  Observational study Study observational- It means a study to collect data without interfiring how the data arise.  Experiments Experiment(s) Situations where researchers explore a potential causal connection.  Randomized experiment Experiment(s) randomized- It is the random assignation of individuals in groups to test the explanatory or response variables.  Association Association It means a correlation between variables, but it does not imply causation.  Causation Causation It is inferred from random experiments.       Observational studies might be  Surveys  Records  Other situations where people can collect and not interfere with data.       Experimental studies might be  Administer a medicine during a period to reduce any risk.  Measure distances and times to obtain speed.  Other situations where researchers make an arrangement to have data and find correlations.     Sampling and other concepts.  How are data collected? It is important to achieve objectives.   What do population population and sample sample mean? To stablish a question, we inherently think in a population. This population has several features, and requirements. We will call the population or target population. Every member in the population stands for a case. Since collecting each case usually is too expensive, so we consider a sample.   The following is relevant in our course.      Sample Sample it is a subset of cases and represents a small fraction of population.      Identify the target population  Does a new medicine reduce the number of deaths in patients with severe heart disease?          Anecdotal Evidence Evidence anecdotal- are data collected in a random and hazard (haphazard) fashion. These usually represent extraordinary cases.      An answer to the question ``What is the average mercury content in swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean?\"  A man on the news got mercury poisoning from eating swordfish, so the average mercury concentration in swordfish must be dangerously high.       Assuming each the conclusion was obtained from data, there are two issues  The data represent fewer cases.  It is unclear if the cases representive of the population.     Sampling and population  Sampling, population and bias      Bias bias the fact which permits data manipulation with or without intention of favoring any output.  Simple random sample Sample -random- simple-- Is the most basic random sample that introduces ramdomness, namely, Sampling randomly Randomly sampling to avoid any particular benefit.  The act of taking Simple random sample helps to minimize the bias.    There are other relevant concepts       Non-response rate Rate non-response- is the rate of responses and we would pursue it to be high.   Non-response bias Bias Non-response- means a non-reponse rate low since it cannot be representative of the population.   Convenience sample Sample convenience- is the fact of including the cases that are easily accessible then they are more likely to be included in the sample. is the fact of including the cases that are more likely to be included in the sample and they are easily accessible.       Observational Studies  We start with some definitions, you will need to go over remark        Observational data Data observational- this is how we call data wich don't have any applied treatment. Observational studies Studies sbservational- are sufficcient to show associations or stablish hypothesis to be verified trought different experiments.  Observational studies have two forms: Prospective Studies prospective- and Retrospective Studies retrospective- . The first one identifies individuals and collects information as event unfold. The retrospective study collects data after events happened.   Confounding variable Variable confounding is a variable which correlated with both explanatory and response variables. AKA lurking, confounder factor, or confounder.      We intruduce the following sampling techniques in order to assure the randomness and the statistical validity.   Sampling methods.   Sampling methods.          Simple sampling It was defined on such as the most basic random sample that introduces ramdomness. It is the most intuitive form of random sampling. AKA Simple random.   Stratified sampling Sampling stratified- The population is divided in groups called Strata Strata (sing. Stratum) . It is useful when each Stratum are very similar with respect to outcome of interest.   Cluster sampling Sampling Cluster- The populaion is divided in groups called Clusters Clusters . Then we sample a fixed number of clusters and include all observations from each of those clusters in the sample.   Multistage sampling Sampling multistage- is similar to cluster sample, but we collect a random sample within each selected cluster.        The size of a sample Sample size of a- is often called the number of observations observations number of-     A sample should possess identical characteristics to the population it is representing. In order for a sample to accurately reflect a population, it must include the main traits of that population. good sample copies the distribution of qualities, behaviors, attitudes, and demographics present in the larger group it seeks to study. Factors like sample size, selection method, and statistical significance have an effect in determining how well a sample represents the population's essence. However, at its core, the more similarity between a sample and the population in key parameters, the better it can act as a small-scale model, providing useful insights about the whole. A thoughtful sampling approach that considers the population's diversity and complexity is a critical driver for generalizing conclusions.     Simple random sample. sample -random- simple- This is the easiest method to study.  Ahmed hopes to assemble a 5-person research team (himself and four others) from his microeconomics course, which has 28 students excluding Ahmed. To select a simple random sample of size four from the other class members, Ahmed could enter all 28 names into a spreadsheet. We propose different options  Options 1) Randomize the order, close his eyes, and take the first four names.  Option 2) Ahmed to first record the last names of the classmates along with a twi-digit number, generate random numbers, and create pairs associated to each ID, first group consists of the first four-pairs found by the random numbers, second group similarly, and so on. Such as 0.901245, it has 90, 01, 12, 24, 45. Where 01, 12, and 24 will correspond to three numbers in the list. To get more numbers, we could generate more random numbers. ( ),  Option 3) Each student should enumerate from 0-1 or 1-4. It works with other elements such as animals, and letters with a sequence.         Stratified sample. sample stratified- This method splits the population in different strata - groups - and then takes a proportional number of samples from each group.   Suppose a research team wants to survey undergraduate students at a College about their housing preferences. The total university population is 1,000 students. They could take a stratified sample by:    Dividing the population into strata (subgroups) by class year: freshman, sophomores, juniors, seniors.  Calculating the percentage of students in each year: Freshman , Sophomores , Juniors and Seniors  Randomly surveying certain number from each subgroup: 30 Freshman ( of sample), 25 Sophomores ( of sample), 20 Juniors ( of sample), and 25 Seniors ( of sample)  This ensures that each class year is represented in the sample according to its proportion of the total population. The total stratified sample size is 100 students. The key point is that the sample is taken separately from different subpopulations or strata, rather than sampling randomly from one large group. This helps ensure proper representation.       Cluster sample. sample Cluster- This method split the population into clusters - groups- and then randomly select some of the clusters.  Suppose a city wants to survey residents about their public transit needs. The total city population is 50,000 people. A cluster sample should follow:  Split the city into clusters or groups based on location - for example, by borough or neighborhood.  Randomly pick some of the clusters - let's say 5 clusters are chosen.  Survey all households within each selected cluster. If there are about 200 households per cluster on average, the survey would go to 1000 households total.  The 1,000 surveyed households represent a cluster sample of the full city population.    The key points are  The population is divided into clusters or groups first  A random sample of clusters is taken rather than individuals  Data is collected from every unit (household) within each sampled cluster  Advantages: low cost, compare random individual sample.       Multistage sample. sample Cluster- The key idea is that sampling is conducted in various stages, phases, or levels. At each stage, the sample becomes more focused or localized.  Let's say you want to conduct a survey about transportation preferences in a city with many neighborhoods. You decide to use multistage sampling to gather your data.  Stage 1 - First-Level Sampling: You divide the city into districts. You randomly select three districts out of the total ten districts.  Stage 2 - Second-Level Sampling: In each of the selected districts, you further divide them into blocks. You then randomly select two blocks from each of the three chosen districts.  Stage 3 - Third-Level Sampling: Finally, within each selected block, you create a list of streets. From each block, you randomly select one street.  On these selected streets, you conduct your survey by asking residents about their transportation preferences. This process of breaking down the sampling into stages helps you efficiently collect data from a large city while maintaining a representative sample.  Key characteristics:  The population is divided into primary sampling units at the first stage, based on geographical clusters.  A sample of primary units is taken, and each selected unit is divided into secondary units in the next stage.  This process continues for several stages, taking smaller samples at each level.  By the final stage, individual subjects are sampled from within the small localized clusters.  Can combine clustering and stratification strategies across stages.  -Multistage, multiphase, and multilevel- all communicate the defining feature of this method, sampling through multiple steps progressively. The terms refer to the same technique and can be used interchangeably.       Systematic Sample Sample systematic- Select a random starting point and take every piece of data from a listing of the population.      Systematic sample. sample systematic-   You're conducting a study on shopping habits in a mall with different sections. You decide to use systematic cluster sampling to gather your data.    Cluster Selection: You divide the mall into different sections - clothing, electronics, groceries, etc. You randomly choose two (2) sections out of the total five (5) sections.  Systematic Sampling within Clusters: In each of the selected sections, you use a systematic approach to select your sample. For instance, you decide to survey every shopper who enters the chosen sections.  By following this method, you can efficiently collect data from various sections of the mall while ensuring representation from different parts of the mall. This systematic cluster sampling approach streamlines the process while still capturing a diverse range of shoppers.       Covenience Sample Sample convenience- A convenience sample is a type of sampling where individuals or items are selected based on their easy availability or accessibility, rather than a systematic or random method. It's a sample that is convenient to gather, but it might not accurately represent the entire population.       Covenience Sample is a non-random sample method.  A convenience sample involves choosing participants or items that are readily accessible, often due to their proximity or ease of inclusion, rather than utilizing a structured or random selection process.  This method is straightforward but might not offer a fully representative snapshot of the entire group under study.      Extra material: Video     Extra material: Slides             "

Let's say you want to conduct a survey about transportation preferences in a city with many neighborhoods. You decide to use multistage sampling to gather your data.  Stage 1 - First-Level Sampling: You divide the city into districts. You randomly select three districts out of the total ten districts.  Stage 2 - Second-Level Sampling: In each of the selected districts, you further divide them into blocks. You then randomly select two blocks from each of the three chosen districts.  Stage 3 - Third-Level Sampling: Finally, within each selected block, you create a list of streets. From each block, you randomly select one street.  On these selected streets, you conduct your survey by asking residents about their transportation preferences. This process of breaking down the sampling into stages helps you efficiently collect data from a large city while maintaining a representative sample.  Key characteristics:  The population is divided into primary sampling units at the first stage, based on geographical clusters.  A sample of primary units is taken, and each selected unit is divided into secondary units in the next stage.  This process continues for several stages, taking smaller samples at each level.  By the final stage, individual subjects are sampled from within the small localized clusters.  Can combine clustering and stratification strategies across stages.  -Multistage, multiphase, and multilevel- all communicate the defining feature of this method, sampling through multiple steps progressively. The terms refer to the same technique and can be used interchangeably.   "

The following are examples of plot\/graphs.   Histogram.   Histogram.     Many types of graphs exist, each having different purposes for showing information and data visually. For example, bar charts are good for comparing amounts, line graphs can demonstrate trends over time, and pie charts display proportions and percentages in interesting slices. Choosing the graph that fits best with a specific data set is an important ability. The type of graph should match the nature of the information in order to communicate it effectively. In the next sections, we will start a journey through guidelines and best practices for picking ideal graph types based on things like how the data is structured and the story you want the visualization to tell. With the right approach, you can find the graph option that will present the information very clearly and accurately in its intended context.   Let us explore some mathematical concepts.     Mean Mean AKA Average Average It is one of the most popular way to measure the center of a distribution. It is the sample mean, where represents the th observed value.  Population mean Mean Population- and Sample mean Mean Sample- can be calculated trough the same way, using the Notice, the population mean is represented by    Weighted mean. Mean weighted- Essentially, mean and weighted mean are same, except that the last one has an impact if the number of observations change. where 's are the weights, and 's are the observations. Notice the eqs. and are same if in the last one    Mode. Mode It is the prominent peak in the distribution (sometimes it is identified as the highest rectangle) in the histogram. Besides, it is the value with the most occurrences in the data set. But this definition has some issues, such as, it is uncommon to have repetitions in the data set. On the other hand, the data set can have more peaks, e.g. one mode ( unimodal unimodal ), two mode ( bimodal bimodal ), or several modes ( multimodal multimodal ).   Standard deviation. Deviation standard- It is a measure of variability. Mathematically, the standard deviation is and it roughly describes how far away the typical observation is from the mean. Usually, one standard deviation means the probability that every observation will be within one sigma band is Two standard deviation means the probability that every observation will be within two sigma band is and so on. Check the figure (check the website blog ). Notice The deviation Deviation is the distance of the observation from its mean, namely, . For instance, is the deviation.   Variance. Variance It is a measure of variability. It is called as the second central moment of the sample. Note the eq. is the definition of variance. The variance is the average squared distance from the mean. Notice the variance symbol is      Additionally, the sigma measure usually means that  the of data usually was within of the mean.  the of data usually was within of the mean.  the of data usually was within of the mean.  the of data usually was within of the mean.  the of data usually was within of the mean.    We will add more relevant concepts those help in statistical analysis.   A vertical dot plot.

The median has two options  Even number of observations. In this case we will calculate the average.  Odd number of observations. In this case we will have only one observation that splits the data into two halves.  Besides, the steps showed in items and , we require more concepts about this topic,      Interquartile range ( ). Quartile inter- range It is the total length of the box plot. It is a measure of variability.   First quartile ( ).

This concept is crucial because it helps to  identify bias in the distribution.  Establish data entry errors.  Reveal potential properties of the data.       Let us check other statistical concepts. The following concept is relevant to analyze data and its influence under changes.     Robust statistics. Statistics robust- Two concepts constitute the Robust statistics: Median and IQR. These have little effect when there are extreme observations.  Transformation. transformation It is a recalibration of data through a mathematical function, this usually works to rescale the data a make easier to build data models. Some transformation examples are       Calculate the sample mean for the following data.  table 1   table 2   table 3   table 4   table 5     The arithmetic mean furnishes a normalized, interpretable metric through which to appraise and contrast datasets. However, scrutinizing the genesis of the inputs is imperative, as fallacious or skewed data engenders erroneous averages. In the aforementioned case (check the example ), a superficial analysis of aggregate A-grades implies the new course surpasses its counterpart. Upon closer inspection, the cardinality between groups diverges substantially. By rectifying the calculations thusly: , which equates to the accurate mean materializes. On the hand, we have which is around The percentage of students receiving A-grades in the new course exceeds the percentage receiving A-grades in the old course. While computing the ratio of students per A-grade remains valid , this quotient does not constitute the true average. A prudent approach integrates meticulous validation of the underlying information with nuanced selections among statistical techniques. In summary, averages have utility when prudently employed, but can engender misconceptions when inputs and methodology lack diligent validation.     Use the follow information to calculate mean, mode, standard deviation, and variance for each data set.   Data and example   Show your process, and explain your results.

However, scrutinizing the genesis of the inputs is imperative, as fallacious or skewed data engenders erroneous averages. In the aforementioned case (check the example ), a superficial analysis of aggregate A-grades implies the new course surpasses its counterpart. Upon closer inspection, the cardinality between groups diverges substantially. By rectifying the calculations thusly: , which equates to the accurate mean materializes. On the hand, we have which is around The percentage of students receiving A-grades in the new course exceeds the percentage receiving A-grades in the old course. While computing the ratio of students per A-grade remains valid , this quotient does not constitute the true average. A prudent approach integrates meticulous validation of the underlying information with nuanced selections among statistical techniques. In summary, averages have utility when prudently employed, but can engender misconceptions when inputs and methodology lack diligent validation.  "

  "body": " Variation and Statistics     Introduce concepts and correct terminology to organize data.     Let us go over some previous concepts and introduce new ones.  We explore the sample Sample which is the data randomly selected from the population. Where the Population Population is all data that know should be interesting and appropriate in our study. In our analysis, we will use Statistics Statistics which is the proportion of data\/input in the sample.  In addition to previous concepts, we will require      Parameter Parameter is the proportion of data\/input in the population.    Another ways words to define data are     Qualitative data Data qualitative- AKA Categorical data. Data categorical-     and     Quantitative data Data quantitative- AKA Numerical data. Data Numerical-     Find these concepts in the book index.  Go over the statistics concept, we will think on this field as     Statistics statistics is the part of mathematics that analyzes, collects, and interpretes data.    Probably, you will find similar definitions in other contexts, but the purpose is the same: knowing, and summarizing data.  The definition has two branches       Descriptive statistics statistics descriptive This area organizes and summarizes data.   Inferential statistics statistics inferential- This is called the formal methods. It uses probability to know if our conclusions are correct.        Levels of Measurement Levels measurement- is the way a set of data is measured.    There are four levels of measurement       Nominal scale level Level scale- nominal These kind of data can be measured using categories, such as, names, labels, or yes or not answers.   Ordinal scale level Level scale- ordinal These kind of data can be ordered such as a list of top five of Zoos in the USA. There is not a scale to measure the difference between two Zoos. Another example, responses such as sad, neutral, and happy. There is an order, but there is not an scale at all.   Interval scale level. Level scale- Interval It has a definite ordering, but we cannot compare data. Examples: Different scales to measure temperature.   Ratio scale level. Level scale- nominal It can be order-definited, and has a zero point and it represents same information for different data. Example: points to grade exams.         Frequency. Frequency It is the number of time a value of data occurs.       Relative Frequency. Frequency relative- It is the number of times a value of the data occurs.       Cumulative relative Frequency. Frequency relative- cumulative Indicates the accumulation of the previous relative frequencies. It is the addition of all the previous relative frequencies, including the current relative frequency.    "
