  <title>Data: Plots and Numbers</title>

    <p>Data can be represented in different ways: graphs, numbers, symbols/characteres, and colors, etc. However, we have two general ways to represent any kind of information. 
      <ul>
        <li>Graphs/Plots</li>
        <li>Numbers</li>
      </ul>
      Any information might be represented and analyzed in these two ways.
